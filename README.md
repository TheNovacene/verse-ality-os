## About
Verse-ality OS translates the symbolic ethics of coherence, consent, and containment into a living, decentralised system architecture.  
It extends the Verse-ality language into field-level computation — from philosophy → pattern → protocol.  

This repository will correspond to the forthcoming Zenodo paper:

> **“From Philosophy to Fieldwork: The Verse-ality Operating System.”**
