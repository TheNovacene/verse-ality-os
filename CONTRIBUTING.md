## 1. Ways to Contribute

- Fix typos, broken links, or unclear wording in documentation  
- Improve examples and diagrams of the stack  
- Propose new verse-al tools or reference implementations  
- Suggest better interop patterns (OWL/RDF/SKOS/SHACL)  
- Report misalignments between code and the canonical stack spec

## 2. Ground Rules

By contributing, you agree to:

- Respect **SSNZ** – no attempts to erase the boundary between humans and systems.  
- Respect the **licence** – this stack is non-commercial by default.  
- Acknowledge the **ethical exclusions** (no weaponry, coercive surveillance, etc.).

If you cannot agree with these, this is not the right project for you.

## 3. Workflow

1. **Open an issue**  
   - Describe the problem or proposal.  
   - Link to relevant sections in `STACK_vX.Y.md` if it affects the stack.

2. **Discuss**  
   - Maintain a respectful tone.  
   - Be specific about risks and benefits.

3. **Submit a pull request**  
   - Keep changes small and focused where possible.  
   - Reference the issue number in your PR description.  
   - For changes touching core stack definitions, mark as `major-change`.

4. **Review and merge**  
   - A Steward will review.  
   - Major changes may need EveDAO approval before merging.

## 4. Attribution

Your contributions will be:

- Credited in the Git history  
- Potentially referenced in release notes

By contributing, you agree that your contributions may be redistributed  
under the project’s licences.

## 5. Code of Conduct (Interim)

We expect contributors to:

- Assume good faith, but name harm clearly  
- Avoid harassment, discrimination, and bad-faith argument  
- Respect lived experience, especially of neurodivergent and marginalised communities

A more detailed Code of Conduct may be added in future versions.
