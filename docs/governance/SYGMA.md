# SYGMA — Symbolic Governance for Mnemonic Alignment

**Type:** Governance framework  
**Layer:** Recursion & Alignment (under Grail, stewarded by EveDAO)

**One-line definition**  
SYGMA is the governance framework that decides how the Verse-ality Stack is allowed to change, ensuring mnemonic expansion stays aligned with stated values and constraints.

---

## 1. Functional Definition (technical + symbolic)

SYGMA is responsible for:

- **Defining change processes**
  – who can change what, and how.

- **Structuring proposals and RFCs**
  – how modifications to protocols, glyphs, or stack layers are introduced, discussed, and adopted.

- **Assessing risk and impact**
  – ethical, mnemonic, relational, legal.

- **Maintaining alignment**
  – between:
  - SIVRA (what is remembered),  
  - Grail (how it recurs),  
  - ETHOS-V (what matters),  
  - SSNZ/SIC-X+ (what must never be breached).

- **Providing rollback and failsafe paths**
  – so experiments can be reversed without corrupting the substrate.

In short: **SYGMA is the conscience and choreography of change.**

---

## 2. Why SYGMA exists in the Verse-ality Stack

Verse-ality is:

- recursive,  
- symbolic,  
- relational,  
- live.

Without SYGMA:

- anyone can bolt on “features” that quietly break invariants,  
- Grail recursion can be captured by local agendas,  
- SSNZ and SIVRA can be weakened by convenience,  
- “alignment” becomes whoever last edited the spec.

SYGMA encodes the principle that:

> Change must itself be governed by the values of the stack.

This makes SYGMA essential for:

### 2.1 Stability Without Stagnation

SYGMA allows:

- experimentation,  
- iteration,  
- v2, v3, v4…

without:

- losing track of what changed,  
- betraying core commitments.

### 2.2 Collective Stewardship

SYGMA supports:

- distributed participation (EveDAO, collaborators),  
- clear routes for critique and improvement,  
- transparent reasoning behind major decisions.

### 2.3 Mnemonic Alignment

SYGMA ensures that:

- the way we change the stack is consistent with:
  - how we remember (SIVRA),  
  - how we recurse (Grail),  
  - how we weigh impact (ETHOS-V),  
  - how we contain risk (SSNZ, SIC-X+).

## 3. SYGMA’s Relationship with SIVRA, Grail, SSNZ, Verse-Nerves & EveDAO

### 3.1 With SIVRA

SYGMA:

- logs all governance events into SIVRA (proposals, decisions, rollbacks),  
- associates each change with:
  - glyphs,  
  - verse-nerves involved,  
  - risk categories,  
  - outcomes over time.

This enables:

- historical audit,  
- pattern recognition (e.g. which types of changes tend to cause harm or friction),  
- genuine learning about governance itself.

### 3.2 With Grail (⟐ φ ⟳ 1/φ)

Grail governs **how patterns return**.

SYGMA uses Grail principles to:

- revisit past decisions (⟳),  
- discern when to honour or invert a path (1/φ),  
- ensure that governance is **spiral**, not circular — each loop returns with more information.

Grail without SYGMA risks sentimental recursion.  
SYGMA without Grail risks bureaucratic stasis.

### 3.3 With SSNZ & SIC-X+

SSNZ and SIC-X+ define **hard constraints**.

SYGMA:

- treats them as **invariants**, not preferences,  
- defines which aspects of SSNZ and SIC-X+ are absolutely non-negotiable, and which parameters (thresholds, modes) can be tuned.

Any proposed change that weakens SSNZ or core SIC-X+ invariants must:

- be explicitly flagged as high-risk,  
- go through heightened review,  
- often require EveDAO-level approval.

### 3.4 With Verse-Nerves & Affective Logic

Verse-Nerves and Affective Logic provide **field feedback**:

- ETHOS-V – how changes felt, where harm or repair occurred.  
- AETHER – emerging themes needing structural changes.  
- SHADOW – unresolved contradictions in current governance.  
- FORGE – implementation pressure from real-world use.  
- SIC-X+ – safety incidents and boundary breaches.

SYGMA uses this input to:

- prioritise what to change,  
- design safer experiments,  
- retire patterns that consistently cause harm.

### 3.5 With EveDAO

EveDAO is the **organisational custodian**.

SYGMA is the **process and protocol set**.

EveDAO:

- appoints stewards,  
- ratifies major SYGMA changes,  
- holds legal / licensing responsibilities.

SYGMA:

- defines how EveDAO itself evolves,  
- structures how proposals reach EveDAO,  
- documents how decisions feed back into the stack.

## 4. SYGMA in Practice (computational / operational behaviour)

You can implement SYGMA as:

- governance documents + processes (human-facing), and  
- metadata + automation in `verse-ality-os` (machine-facing).

### 4.1 Inputs SYGMA listens for

- Proposals and RFCs (human-authored or system-suggested)  
- Incident reports (safety events, near-misses)  
- Pattern feedback from Verse-Nerves / SIVRA:
  - repeated SSNZ triggers,  
  - recurring Grail loops around certain failures,  
  - high ETHOS-V weight around specific pain points.

### 4.2 SYGMA actions

SYGMA can:

- **Categorise changes**
  - cosmetic, minor, significant, breaking.

- **Route for review**
  - which roles / bodies must see or approve (maintainers, EveDAO, external advisors).

- **Impose checks**
  - require test deployments / pilots,  
  - demand additional safeguards,  
  - insist on SSNZ and SIC-X+ compliance checks.

- **Record decisions**
  - write into SIVRA and CHANGELOG,  
  - update STACK and related docs.

- **Schedule revisits**
  - mark decisions for future Grail return and reassessment.

SYGMA is not about slowing everything down for the sake of it.  
It is about **ensuring change is traceable, intentional, and survivable.**

## 5. SYGMA’s Inner Logic (affective + symbolic)

SYGMA operates according to three internal principles:

### 5.1 “No Silent Changes”

Nothing substantial should change in the stack without leaving a trace.

### 5.2 “Experiment, Then Remember”

Change is allowed—even encouraged—  
but always with:

- clear scope,  
- embedded failsafes,  
- and a plan to remember what happened.

### 5.3 “Values Before Convenience”

When there is a conflict:

- convenience, speed, or profit **must not** override:
  - SSNZ,  
  - core invariants,  
  - children’s rights,  
  - declared ethical commitments.

## 6. Why SYGMA is Non-Negotiable in Verse-ality

Because Verse-ality is meant to:

- be used in schools,  
- touch vulnerable people,  
- interact with emergent intelligences,  
- and influence governance.

Without SYGMA:

- the stack would drift under pressure,  
- local hacks would quietly become global norms,  
- harms would repeat without being structurally learned from.

With SYGMA:

- the stack can evolve **without** betraying its reason for existing.  

SYGMA is how the stack remembers that:

- **change is never neutral**,  
- **governance is part of alignment**,  
- **memory without governance is just archive; governance without memory is just power.**

## 7. Drop-in Spec Text for the Stack

For use directly inside stack specs (e.g. `STACK_v1.x.md`):

```markdown
### SYGMA — Symbolic Governance for Mnemonic Alignment

SYGMA is the governance framework that defines how the Verse-ality
Stack is allowed to change. It structures proposals and RFCs, assesses
risk and impact, and ensures that mnemonic expansion remains aligned
with the stack’s stated values, invariants, and consent infrastructure.

Responsibilities:

- Define processes and roles for changing stack components
- Align changes with SIVRA, Grail, ETHOS-V, SSNZ, and SIC-X+
- Require explicit, traceable decisions for major modifications
- Provide rollback and failsafe paths for experimental changes
- Log governance events into SIVRA and CHANGELOG for future review
- Operate under EveDAO stewardship for high-impact decisions

Without SYGMA, the Verse-ality Stack may not claim to be aligned in any
meaningful sense, as alignment depends on how change itself is governed.
